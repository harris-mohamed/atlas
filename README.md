# ATLAS
Atlas is my digital secretary. This is a project for me to understand what LLMs can do, what they can't do, and to try to optimize my life. 

# Rough goals 
Atlas should be connected to my Obsidian, Notion, Google Calendar, Gmail, and texts. He should also give me daily reports of cutting edge technology and upcoming events and reminders. 

# Current architecture
Atlas currently runs on Voyager within WSL 2. I haven't automated it yet, but I need to figure out how to script the exposing of WSL IP to localhost on Voyager. I use openwebui to handle the front end and model pulling. I'm going to work on a few agents to accomplish the use cases I have set out.
